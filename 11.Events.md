You: 

I have shared a transcript on "Introduction to Events". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "So guys, we have seen metrics getting queried and graph processes getting queried and graphed. Now, another important aspect of monitoring is even monitoring events. You can say other messages that are triggered when a specific condition is met. In monitoring terms, events represent a notable change in the state of a monitored application or device, for example, and even can represent an error or exception generated by the application. The crossing of a performance threshold or configuration changes in the environment or operational change in the application such as JVM restart. There are thousands of cases where events are generated based on the severity. Events can help you discover health issues across your environment from a single console. Datadog also gives you a consolidated interface to search, analyze and filter events from any source in one place. And if you have question on how events are generated and captured, the answer is same. The Datadog agent supported integrations and custom events. Same like the mattresses, processes and others, the agent automatically gathers events from the host without any additional setup. Also, there are more than 100 data log integrations that supports even collection, including Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, RW, X, and Agios. You can submit your own custom events using the Datadog API. Custom Agent Check and dock stats to. Furthermore, to retain data for events for a long time and to create and monitor historical events, you can generate metrics with 15 month retention from any even search query. This is same as we did for processes. Okay, So now in this section, I'm going to cover events from one of the integrations and custom metrics using custom agent check and talk strategy. After capturing the events from source, obviously there would be an event exploder to where you can filter those collected events. The Events Exploder in Datadog displays the most recent events generated by infrastructure and services such as code deployments, service health configuration changes. Or it can be monitoring alerts. Instead that even Explorer events are used as data source to graph the widgets. You can build time, series tables and top list widgets over even search queries. Well, I'm not going to speak much of even Explorer because anyways, we are going to see that. All right. So with this brief knowledge in mind, starting from next lecture, I will be collecting events via various submission methods and then at last will be viewing them in data log. Keep learning."

Here's a **crystal-clear explanation** of the **"Introduction to Events"** in **Datadog**, enhanced with interactive-style icons to make concepts more intuitive and visually memorable:

---

## 🧠 **What are Events?**

Events are **notable changes** in the state of your monitored systems.  
They’re like **real-time alerts or messages** triggered when something specific happens.

---

### 🔔 **Events Can Represent:**

| Scenario | Example |
| --- | --- |
| ❌ **Errors/Exceptions** | Application crash or stack trace |
| 🚨 **Performance Thresholds** | CPU > 90%, Memory > 80% |
| 🔧 **Configuration Changes** | Env variable update, config file modified |
| 🔁 **Operational Changes** | JVM restarted, Service redeployed |

---

## 🔍 **Why Events Matter?**

🧩 Events provide **context** around what’s happening in your environment — they are the **"why"** behind alerts.

💡 You can **see the health of the entire system** from a **single console**.

You: 

Great. Thanks. Next one is "Event Log Check to Capture Windows Events". The Transcript is nearly 10 minutes long. Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. No part of the Transcript should be ignored and no excuse on this. "I will first capture the events using my current Datadog agent installation on Windows. In this lecture you're going to see how data log agent, which is currently running on my windows, watches and forwards the Windows event logs. Basically it is supported as when 32 event log integration. Let's start. First of all, it is no doubt that Windows operating system would be generating some events for a number of activities that you perform on it. It can be installation or an installation of a software using administrator access to open something and countless other things are there for which events can be generated. Those events can be collected using the Windows event Log check The Windows Event. Log check is already included in the data log agent package and there is no additional installation required. It means with the data log agent being already installed on Windows, we just have to enable and configure it to collect those system and application events. How exactly to do that, please watch this lecture fully. To configure this check, you have to go to convert directory. And here you configure the. When 32 event log configuration file. Copy this and rename it to. Gone proximal. I'll make the configurations in this file. Likewise, in Windows, events are usually returned to event log channels where a channel is basically a sync that collects a type of events. Each channel type has an intended audience which determines the type of events that you write to the channel. Channels can be like application channel, system channel, security channel, etc. And if you wish to see full list of event log channels in Windows, you can run this command in PowerShell. Get window event list log. And let me sort it also to see the most active channels. So as for the record count. In descending. See a long list of channels would appear. In this list. Long name is the channel name application system and hundreds of other channels out there in each of these channels. A particular type of events are written. Now you will be wondering that how all this is related to Datadog. Actually, in this configuration file, we have to basically configure those channels only for which you want to collect the window events. Depending on the nature of events you want to collect and work on. You configure this file. So let's say I want to collect events from application and security channels. So this is how a basic configuration will be done for that. I'll go down. Here in the log section. Since Windows operating system collect events as log events, hence the settings of it, you will find a similar to log collection. Now in the fields. First of all, specify that type of input source. The value of it can be TCP UDP file or Windows event or is definitely Windows event. Second option is general path. This is the general name. I will do it for security first. Third option is source. Which defines the source name from where the events are coming. Local laptop. This for us. Then optionally you can add service. The name of the service that generates the event. And tags as well. This completes the configuration for security channel. Now copy paste it for application. I will change the values. This would be application. And rest is same. Save it. So this was step one to configure the logs parameter. Step two is to configure the instances. Each channel also requires an entry in the instances section of the file. Since I'm doing it for two events, so two instances have to be configured. For that I'll go up. Hear you right. But one is application. And second is. Security. The only required field is path here, which points to the channel name itself. Save it. So guys, this is the minimum of minimum configuration required to collect application and security events. But there are many other options available to enhance the event collection experience. In this instance, his parameter. You can define filters to let only selected events pass through. Filters can be added on source type of events, ID, or maybe on some other fields as well. Then. You can set the event priority. Said the auth type server. Many things can be said for each instance. By each instance I mean for each channel. And do note that instances are independent of each other. So in short, you can understand that if this below block is configured just to configure the type of channel and source from where the event has to be collected. But even collection process, however, can further be defined for each and all type using this instances. Additionally. You can set global parameters to in this initialize configuration block, you know like this tag event ID if set to true instructs the check to add an event ID tag to events. Tag sed instructs the check to add an ID tag to events. Similarly, you can check the rest. Self explanatory. They are. And I'm reiterating that this initialize configuration block is global. Whatever options you define here are applicable to all the instances. A lot, provide complex configurations and we'll go with the minimum of configurations only. Save the file. And one more thing. What you have to do is enable the log collection. Since Windows events are written as log events. So you have to enable the log collection. For that you come to this data yaml file and write logs underscore enabled is equal to two. You might not have to do this enablement for other integrations. It is specific for Windows even collection only. Okay, so everything is ready to collect events from windows. Let's save this and restart the agent. Now to check the status of it. You come to agent manager and scroll down to log agent. See when 32 event log is there and the status is OC perfect. Now to create the events. Usually you don't have to perform any special step to create events in Windows because you know, the current activities which are going on in your Windows Host would be enough to create events. So nothing much to do from host side. Now, if I take you to the Event Explorer in Datadog website. Go to events. Yes, the events are there. Out of all the security related events, one event would be of the data box agent itself. The agent upon start creates an event and remaining events are of security like a user's local group. Membership was enumerated. It doesn't matter. Actually, it is as per the use case. So yeah, our goal has been achieved. We are able to send events from Windows operating system. Next is the turn of generating and submitting custom events that is covered in next lesson. Thank you."

Here is a **crystal-clear breakdown** of the transcript on **“Event Log Check to Capture Windows Events”** using **interactive-style icons** and an easy-to-follow structure. Every part of the transcript is covered thoroughly — no skips, no excuses.

---

## 🧭 **Overview**

You’ll learn how to **capture Windows Event Logs** using the **Datadog Agent** that’s already installed on your Windows machine. This involves enabling and configuring a special **Windows Event Log Check** that monitors things like app errors, restarts, and security events.

---

## 🧱 **1\. Understanding Windows Events**

🖥️ The **Windows OS** generates events for many activities like:

-   🛠️ Installing/Uninstalling Software
    
-   🔐 Admin-level operations
    
-   🔄 System changes or failures
    

🧾 These events are stored in **Event Log Channels**, like:

-   🟠 `Application`
    
-   🔵 `System`
    
-   🔒 `Security`
    
-   …plus **hundreds** of others
    

To view all:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ListLog * | Sort-Object RecordCount -Descending
```

---

## 🧰 **2\. Enabling Windows Event Log Integration**

Datadog supports **Win32 Event Log** collection **out of the box** — no extra installation needed.

📂 Navigate to:

```makefile
C:\ProgramData\Datadog\conf.d\win32_event_log.d\
```

✅ Steps:

1.  **Copy** `conf.yaml.example`
    
2.  **Rename** it to `conf.yaml`
    

---

## ⚙️ **3\. Configuring `conf.yaml` (Step-by-Step)**

### 🪵 **A. Log Section (defines what logs to collect)**

For each log source (like `Security`, `Application`):

```yaml
logs:
  - type: windows_event
    channel_path: Security
    source: my-laptop
    service: my-service-name
    tags:
      - env:dev
  - type: windows_event
    channel_path: Application
    source: my-laptop
```

📌 You specify:

-   `type`: must be `windows_event`
    
-   `channel_path`: name of the channel
    
-   `source`: hostname or label
    
-   `service`: (optional) service generating events
    
-   `tags`: (optional) extra context
    

---

### 📦 **B. Instances Section (sets behavior per channel)**

Each channel from above needs its own block:

```yaml
instances:
  - path: Application
  - path: Security
```

✔️ Only **`path`** is required.

You can also add:

-   `filters` (by source, event ID, etc.)
    
-   `priority`, `auth_type`, `server`...
    

🧠 Think of it like this:

> `logs:` = What to collect  
> `instances:` = How to collect

---

### 🌐 **C. Init Config Block (Global Settings)**

Optional global options:

```yaml
init_config:
  tag_event_id: true
  tag_sid: true
```

These settings affect **all instances**:

-   `tag_event_id`: adds event ID as a tag
    
-   `tag_sid`: adds security identifier
    
-   Others are **self-explanatory**
    

---

## 🔓 **4\. Enable Log Collection in Agent**

⚠️ **Windows event logs are treated as log entries**, so log collection must be enabled.

Edit `datadog.yaml` (main config file):

```yaml
logs_enabled: true
```

🟡 This step is **specific to Windows event logs** and may not be needed for other integrations.

---

## 🔁 **5\. Restart the Agent**

Restart the Datadog Agent to apply changes.

Then:

1.  Open **Agent Manager**
    
2.  Scroll to **Log Agent**
    
3.  Confirm `win32_event_log` appears and status is ✅ **OK**
    

---

## 📡 **6\. Viewing the Events in Datadog**

No need to generate fake events!  
👉 Your system is already active and producing events.

Go to **Datadog UI**:

```vbnet
→ Events → Event Explorer
```

📌 You’ll see:

-   Events like "User's group membership was enumerated"
    
-   Events from the **Datadog Agent itself** on startup
    
-   Security events from the `Security` channel
    

🎯 **Mission Accomplished**: Events are now being captured and visible in Datadog.

Would you like a **diagram or visual cheat sheet** for this process?

You: 

Superb. Next one is "Create Custom Events". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "So in the previous video we discussed about the events getting generated from Windows Operating system. Basically, we had used the 132 even log integration there. And similarly, if you are using other supported integrations like Kubernetes, Docker Jenkins or other, the events get collected very easily. However, this lecture is dedicated to submit custom events, just like we submitted custom metrics in previous section. We are going to submit custom events as well using the same codes. And again, custom metrics submission was done using custom agent check and dock stats. Custom events will also be submitted using both the mediums saying this. I will directly start with custom agent check. This is the already developed code. So let's say the requirement is that along with the metric and even shall also be generated. So you simply write self dot event. In this method provide the arguments dictionary. The following keys and data types are available in the event dictionary. Out of all timestamp, even type and message title are mandatory, and the description to each of these keys is self explanatory. You can pause this video and do a quick reading. In my event I will provide timestamp. It will be the current time. Then even type. Let's say. Info. Message title. And a lot type. It's also in. Save it and restart the agent. Now go to Event Explorer. Great. Our custom event is there with all those tags set in application and the host tags. I'll come to this even exploder part separately. As of now, we are just concerned about events reaching data servers, which is happening. Completing this last is custom event submission through Docs D. For that. Also, we have an application ready with this. I'll go with the counter code of strategy. Here. Also, let's say after every request is served. If you want to create an event, then add the stats event method as the last line of nugget method. These are the arguments of this method pretty much same. It's just her title and message are mandatory ones. So I will write. Title. Message can be. Then the load type is in full. And last is tax. That's it. Now run the code. Refresh it multiple times. Now go to Event Explorer. Wonderful. The events from our python application using dog stats DX are also here. Even submission being done. The last thing to discuss in event section is this Event Exploder review. Well, nothing much to discuss here. It's the same Explorer as we have seen previously for processes, but for the sake of discourse I will discuss a few things around it in the next video."

ChatGPT: 

Here is a **crystal-clear breakdown** of the topic **"Create Custom Events in Datadog"**, presented with **interactive icons** and zero omissions. This guide explains both **custom agent check** and **DogStatsD** methods for submitting custom events.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Learn how to **generate and submit custom events** to Datadog programmatically — just like how you previously submitted **custom metrics**.

---

## 🧠 **What is a Custom Event?**

A **custom event** is a user-defined message (like an alert or status update) that:

-   🚨 Describes important runtime conditions
    
-   💬 Adds context to your monitoring
    
-   📬 Is manually submitted from code (not auto-collected)
    

---

## 🔧 **Two Ways to Submit Custom Events**

| Method | Tool Used | Where to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🛠️ **Agent Check** | Python class extending `AgentCheck` | Backend logic or scripts |
| 📦 **DogStatsD** | `statsd.event()` | Web apps, services (like Flask, Django, etc.) |

---

## 1️⃣ **Custom Agent Check Method**

🔁 Let’s say you already have a **custom metric being sent**.

➡️ Now you want to **submit a custom event** *alongside it*.

### ✍️ Add this line in your Agent Check code:

```python
self.event({
    "timestamp": time.time(),            # ⏰ Current time
    "event_type": "info",                # 📌 Type of event
    "msg_title": "Custom Check Title",   # 🧾 Title (required)
    "msg_text": "Event triggered!",      # 💬 Description (required)
    "alert_type": "info",                # ✅ Alert level (info, warning, error, success)
    "tags": ["env:dev", "team:backend"], # 🏷️ Tags (optional)
})
```

### ✅ Mandatory Keys:

-   `timestamp` (float or int)
    
-   `event_type` (str)
    
-   `msg_title` (str)
    
-   `msg_text` (str)
    

📌 **Restart the Datadog Agent** after saving the file!

Then go to:

```vbnet
Datadog UI → Events → Event Explorer
```

🎉 Your custom event is now live!

---

## 2️⃣ **DogStatsD Method (For Apps)**

💡 Let’s say you’re running a **Python web app**. You can send an event *after serving a request*.

### 🧑‍💻 Example with DogStatsD:

```python
from datadog import initialize, statsd

statsd.event(
    title="User Login Detected",            # 🧾 Required
    text="A user has successfully logged in", # 💬 Required
    alert_type="info",                      # ✅ Optional
    tags=["env:prod", "app:webapp"]         # 🏷️ Optional
)
```

📌 Place this **after any key action** (like request served, user signed up, etc.)

### 📟 Then:

1.  Run the app
    
2.  Trigger the event (e.g., refresh page, simulate activity)
    
3.  Visit Event Explorer
    

📍 **Your DogStatsD-based event will appear there too!**

---

## 🧭 **Recap Table**

| Feature | Agent Check | DogStatsD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Used In | Monitoring scripts | Web/Service code |
| Library | `AgentCheck` | `datadog.statsd` |
| Method | `self.event({...})` | `statsd.event(...)` |
| Required Fields | `timestamp`, `event_type`, `msg_title`, `msg_text` | `title`, `text` |
| Tags | Optional | Optional |
| Restart Needed | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Visualization | Event Explorer | Event Explorer |

---

## 🧪 **Quick Example Flow**

1.  ✅ Agent Check generates metric
    
2.  📣 Add `self.event()`
    
3.  🌀 Restart agent
    
4.  👀 Check in Datadog Events tab
    

OR

1.  ⚙️ App serves a request

Would you like a **cheat sheet or code snippet pack** for quick copy-paste use in your projects?

You: 

Last one is "Event Explorer". Pls explain in a crystal clear format with interactive icons. "Welcome, guys, to this video where I'm going to discuss about even Explorer in Dog, even Explorer as its need. No definition is a data log view where you can view filter aggregate events coming to Datadog from a number of sources. The events Exploder displays the most recent events generated by your infrastructure and services such as code deployments, service health configuration changes, or monitoring alerts. Not sorting through this page. First of all, on top you have filtering panel. Events displayed on the page can be filtered using tags. This Even explorer by default displays all the event types. You can, however, filter your events by writing search queries here or this face ID panel can be used as a quick filter. While this view gives you the option of filtering, only you can switch to event analytics view. That extends the Event Explorer page with views, data aggregation and grouping capabilities for troubleshooting and monitoring. Here in this page, basically you can build the same filtering and grouping which we created previously for metrics. Then we have Face it panel here. Face it. Panel is configurable. You can add or remove faces in this panel, but that's all is covered in the log section of this course. Then you can click on any of the events to get full details about it. It contains source, name, host and service name. Even attributes of the panel lists the event attributes as JSON. I can see that priority and time stamp field got automatically added by Datadog. An interesting thing is that these fields are clickable and you can perform many operations with a single click. You know, like if you want to filter on priority as normal. Simply click on it and do the filtering. See the view got filtered on priority as normal. Then this field can also be added as a column in the table. But a column got added in the table. So, you know, that was a handy feature for doing certain things with a single click. Anyways, if we move ahead in the side panel infrastructure tab, we'll have the host info from where these events came from. Then a quick click of the metrics and processes from that host. Nothing complex. So yeah, there was nothing much to discuss about it. And with this video we are done with the event section as well. Thank you."
